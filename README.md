✈️ Aviation Insights – End-to-End Data Engineering Project
📌 Project Overview

Aviation Insights is an end-to-end data engineering project designed to analyze U.S. domestic flight performance data, focusing on delays, cancellations, diversions, and airline reliability.
The project demonstrates how large-scale aviation datasets can be ingested, transformed, and optimized using modern Lakehouse architecture principles.

This repository showcases a production-ready data pipeline built using Apache Spark, Databricks, and Delta Lake, following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to enable scalable analytics and data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Key Objectives

Build a scalable and reliable data pipeline using Lakehouse architecture

Handle large aviation datasets efficiently using Apache Spark

Implement clean data modeling and transformations

Enable analytics-ready datasets for reporting and insights

Apply Delta Lake features for reliability, performance, and governance
